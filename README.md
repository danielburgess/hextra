# hextra - The ROM Hacking Hex Editor

This is still pretty new and so most features are still not implemented.

I've implemented a basic html/javascript template for the hex editor functions.

The goal with this project is to make the code as easy as possible to work with while giving the best hex editor experience for experienced ROM hackers.

The focus will initially be on basic features and then will branch out to SNES/SFC specific features.


## List of planned features:
* Add selection support
* Store loaded values on the elements and change the background class of cells when values are different than file
* Address conversions built into the editor
* Table support and text viewing
* hex to asm view -- for program views
* categorize different areas of a rom (similar to bookmarking)
* pointer table traversal
* pointer table data block auto-categorization and marking
* exporting/importing of data
* searching by "text" or hexadecimal value
* save most recent searches in history
* project saving/rom exporting
* customizable script editing components
* customizable tile editor
* file diff and comparison
* hextra main methods must be converted to a class
